# JaWoodle's Doomsday Settings

## 7 Days 2 Die Modlet

Custom settings for JaWoodle's "Doomsday" let's play series, whereas all head shots do 300% normal damage, however all other damage is reduced to only 25% of normal.

If you're looking to replicate the series, you'll also want the following game settings:

- Game difficulty to "Warrior" -- further decreases your damage and increases the zombies damage
- Set all zombie speeds to "Nightmare"
- Set Blood Moon count to "16"

Have fun!
